Welcome to The Wild Oasis Hotel Management Application! 🌴🏨

The Wild Oasis is a modern, user-friendly hotel management application designed to streamline hotel operations.

Plus, it comes packed with powerful features to simplify hotel administration and improve efficiency!

The purpose of this project is to apply my advanced <strong><b>JavaScript</b></strong> and <strong><b>database query</b></strong> skills in a real-world web application. Additionally, it serves as an opportunity to further enhance my expertise in <strong><b>React.js</b></strong> and modern web development practices.  

This project is built using <strong><b>CSS</b></strong>, <strong><b>JavaScript</b></strong>, and <strong><b>React.js</b></strong> for the frontend, with <strong><b>Supabase</b></strong> as the backend for database management and authentication.
